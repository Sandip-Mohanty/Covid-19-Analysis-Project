# COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination data across different states in India. It provides insights into vaccination distribution, confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates through various visualizations. The goal is to understand the impact of vaccination efforts and the state-wise distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

## Datasets Used

1. **COVID-19 India Dataset** (`covid_19_india.csv`):
   - Contains confirmed, death, and recovery statistics for COVID-19 across Indian states.
   - Columns include `State/UnionTerritory`, `Confirmed`, `Deaths`, `Cured`, and `Date`.

2. **COVID Vaccination Statewise Dataset** (`covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`):
   - Contains vaccination data segmented by state, gender, and age group.
   - Columns include `State`, `Total Doses Administered`, `First Dose Administered`, `Second Dose Administered`, and gender-specific doses.

3. **Statewise Testing Details Dataset** (`StatewiseTestingDetails.csv`):
   - Provides information about testing conducted across various `States`, including `TotalSamples`, `Negative`, and `Positive` results.

## Skills and Tools
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Python (Pandas)
- Data Visualization: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Reporting: Jupyter Notebook

## Visualization
- Total Confirmed Cases by State.
- Daily COVID Confirmed Cases by State.
- Total Deaths by State.
- Total Cured Cases by State.
- Total Samples Collected by State.
- Total Negative and Positive Cases by State.
- Total Doses Administered by State.
- Comparison of First and Second Doses Administered Across States.
- Total Doses Administered by Gender.
- Doses Distribution in Age Groups by Each State.

## Conclusion 
This analysis provides a detailed view of COVID-19 vaccination efforts and outcomes across various states in India. By understanding the data, policymakers and health authorities can make informed decisions to improve vaccination strategies and manage the pandemic effectively.
